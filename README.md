# CharacterSheet Engine (Static + IndexedDB)

Static GitHub Pages app. No servers. Per-device storage via IndexedDB.

## Features
- Ruleset import (JSON) stored locally
- Character create/edit (name, class, level, abilities, HP, AC, speed, portrait)
- HP damage/heal controls + temp HP clear
- Inventory add/remove (qty + notes)
- Basic derived stats (PB, ability mods, spell DC/attack)
- Level-up planner applies grants/choices from ruleset progression

## Deploy
Commit this repo to GitHub and enable Pages on `main` / root.

## Notes
This is deliberately generic. You control rulesets locally to avoid hosting copyrighted data.
